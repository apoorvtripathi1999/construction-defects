    "This project proposes a system which uses a convolutional neural network and detects defects in construction sites. The neural network is deployed on Amazon Web Service as an Application Programming Interface API. The API will equip single image processing and batch processing of images. The project will automate the defect detection process and improve critical metrics like cost and safety during construction.\n"
